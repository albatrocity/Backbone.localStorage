# Exoskeleton localStorage Adapter v1.1.8

A fork of [Backbone.localStorage](https://github.com/jeromegn/Backbone.localStorage) that eliminates dependencies on jQuery and Underscore. Good when using [Exoskeleton](https://github.com/paulmillr/exoskeleton) as a drop-in replacement for Backbone.

Basically a monkeypatch until [this pull request](https://github.com/jeromegn/Backbone.localStorage/pull/109) is merged.
